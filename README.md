Hello! <br> <br>Food for thought...<br>
To what extent should one trust a statement that a program is free of Trojan horses? Perhaps it is more important to trust the people who wrote the software. <br> <br>
Three things are required to accomplish anything complex: <br>
1) a plan <br>
2) the knowledge to put the plan into effect <br>
3) the spirit to carry it through to completion <br> <br> 
We may not always succeed when we tried our hardest, but at least we tried. That's how we improve. <br> <br>
