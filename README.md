Hello!<br>
Food for thought...<br><br>

Three things are required to accomplish anything complex:<br>
1) a plan<br>
2) the knowledge to put the plan into effect<br>
3) the spirit to carry it through to completion<br><br>

We may not always succeed when we tried our hardest, but at least we tried. That's how we improve.<br><br>
