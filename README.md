Hello! <br> <br>
We may not always succeed when we tried our hardest, but at least we tried. That's how we improve. <br> <br>
Three things are required to accomplish anything complex: <br>
1) a plan <br>
2) the knowledge to put the plan into effect <br>
3) the spirit to carry it through to completion <br>
