Food for thought...</p>
<br><br>
<b>Only three things are required to accomplish anything complex:</b>
<ol>
<li> a plan</li>
<li> the knowledge to put the plan into effect</li>
<li> the spirit to carry it through to completion<br></li>
</ol>
<p><b>We may not always succeed when we tried our hardest, but at least we tried. That's how we improve.</b></p>
